Very slight tweaks over the basic lilypond empty staff paper template that I found somewhere in the help. 
There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Allows quick config of empty paper according to:

orientation

number of total staves (as distinct from systems)

number of staves per system.

staff size

E.g., to get 6 systems of conventional piano staff:
```
number_staves = 12
staves_per_system = 2
```

Doesn't show page number or lilypond footer.
